            <p>Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Bruce Mathers III, is a multi-platinum selling rapper, songwriter,
                and
                record producer.<br> Often considered one of the greatest rappers of all time, he rose to mainstream
                popularity
                in the late 90s with his provocative lyrics and versatile flow.<br> His songs often touch on personal
                struggles,
                societal issues and controversies, while his alter-ego "Slim Shady" allows him to showcase a more
                outrageous
                and comedic side.<br> Eminem has won numerous awards and accolades for his music, including 15 Grammys
                and an
                Academy Award for Best Original Song.
